# Notes
In this folder we will store notes. Notes serve to mitigate the readability problems that come with large comments.

Notes are also useful for describing general concepts and can be referred to multiple times.

## creating a note

we use `-- See Note [folder/file]` to refer to a note in this folder.

any note must start with 
```
Note [folder/file]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```
so one can easily check they are at the right note.
